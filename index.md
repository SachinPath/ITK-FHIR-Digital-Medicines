{% include warning.html content="This **temporary** site is provided to document the development of the Digital Medicines Specification and is being updated regularly. It is advised not to develop against these specifications until a formal announcement has been made." %}

## Introduction ##

The Digital Medicines Specification supports the following care communications:

* Pharmacy Vaccinations
* Pharmacy Emergency Supply
* Pharmacy New Medicine Service
* Pharmacy Medication Review
* Pharmacy Digital Minor Illness Referral Service
* Pharmacy Appliance Use Review

FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

Find out more on the [INTEROPen website](http://interopen.org/).

This documentation builds on work done by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) in defining headings for clinical documents.
