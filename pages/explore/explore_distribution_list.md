## Distribution list  Content ##
The Distribution list section carries a list of recipients of the document. PRSB Elements should be formatted as subheadings in any HTML sent.

The document may be sent to any number of recipients, however all recipients should be included in the distribution list to allow individual recipients to know who else has received a copy.
